# URL Shortener Frontend

This is the front part of my URL shortener app! It’s where you type a long URL, hit "Shorten," and get a tiny URL plus a QR code to share. It’s built with React and lives on GitHub Pages at [https://jagan515.github.io/Url-shortner/](https://jagan515.github.io/Url-shortner/).

- **Repo**: [github.com/Jagan515/Url-shortner](https://github.com/Jagan515/Url-shortner)
- **Live Site**: [jagan515.github.io/Url-shortner/](https://jagan515.github.io/Url-shortner/)

## What It Does
You paste a big URL (like [https://cloud.mongodb.com/](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)), and it talks to the backend to shrink it into something small (like [https://url-backend-tau.vercel.app/we](https://url-backend-tau.vercel.app/we)). Then it shows you the short link and a QR code you can scan!

## Features
- Shortens URLs with a click.
- Lets you pick a custom short name (optional).
- Gives you a QR code for easy sharing.
- Works on your phone or computer.

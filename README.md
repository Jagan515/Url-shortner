# URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortening app! You paste a long URL, and it gives you a short one (plus a QR code) that you can share. Itâ€™s like a magic shrink ray for links! The frontend (the part you see) lives on GitHub Pages, and the backend (the part that does the shrinking) runs on Vercel.

## How It Works
1. **Frontend**: Built with React and Vite, hosted on GitHub Pages. You type a URL, hit "Shorten," and it shows a short link and QR code.
2. **Backend**: Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, hosted on Vercel. It shrinks the URL, saves it, and makes the QR code.
3. **Database**: MongoDB stores the long URLs and their short codes.

When you click a short link (like `https://url-backend-tau.vercel.app/we`), it takes you to the original long URL!

## Features
